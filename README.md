# Compression-and-Decompression

<p>Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation of the data. Compression of data is useful as it reduces the resources required to store the data and transmit it over the network. When we talk about data transmission, it is called source encoding. Before transmitting the data, encoding is done for security purposes. The reverse process of compression is called decompression which is used to get the original data from the compressed data.</p>

## Project Objective
<p>We sometimes face problems related to memory issues while saving or transferring any document or a file. Hence, there is a need to compress it so that it is reduced in size and can be transferred and processed easily. Data Compression and Decompression provide users to store data in less space and also easier for the user to transfer over the network. The Compression reduces the file of the size so that we can share it easily over any network even at a slow speed. This project aims at compressing and decompressing different types of files stored in our computer system at a particular destination location. There are four different algorithms that can be chosen to compress or decompress the files.</p>


### Algorithms used in this project:
<ul>
  <li>LZW</li>
  <li>GZIP</li>
  <li>HUFFMAN</li>
  <li>RUNLENGTH</li>
</ul>
